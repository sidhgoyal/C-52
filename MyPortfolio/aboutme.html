            About me

        <p>
            I am a computer programmer 
            and this is to make everyone 
            aware of the Language Of 
            Computers. I have a keen 
            interest in coding and 
            started doing it in this 
            lockdown period. I got 
            this inspiration from my 
            father who was designing 
            a software for his factory. 
            So, I thought why not to 
            give this knowledge to other 
            children. That's why I am here 
            to teach and develop the 
            interest in students.
